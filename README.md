# Object Detection using Kalman Filters

This repository uses YOLO and Kalman Filters to track a single and multiple moving balls and predict the center of the ball

The code is located at ```main.ipynb``` with input being ```single_ball.mp4``` and ```multiple_balls.avi```. After running the notebook, output has been stored in ```single_ball_kalman.mp4``` and ```multiple_balls_kalman.mp4```
